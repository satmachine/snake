# What is it?

Yume means dream in japanese. Yume Snake therefore... you know what, i didn't come up with this, stupid Gemini did. why not.

# But why?

... because it's fun!


# cool mechanisms that me, the human, came up with

1. when you reach 250 echos, the season will change, then every 250 echos after.2
2. snake can only hold breath for 3 secs under water, unless boosting or going really fast as snake will be able to skid on water - common knowledge.
3. rocks will usually knock out snake, unless snake boosts - which allows the snake to break rocks.
4. there's gravity - so going up hill is slower and down will gradually get faster.
5. longer you are, faster you are.. i think.
